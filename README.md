App created as an assignemt.

I've tried to make a simple sounding task into a project that's as close to production quality as possible, while using the newest development paradigms in React, although I intentially left out some things in order to keep it simple, such as PropTypes and Loading states.

You can see the project at https://ace-pokedex.herokuapp.com

Project made with create-react-app, React Hooks, React-Redux, Redux-Thunk, Styled-Components.
